### COMP3010 Algorithm Theory And Design

This unit covers general issues of the theory of computation and algorithm design, including computability and complexity. The general principles are illustrated by designing several very efficient algorithms with applications in telecommunication networks, cryptography and other important fields.

This repository includes workshops questions and their answers.
